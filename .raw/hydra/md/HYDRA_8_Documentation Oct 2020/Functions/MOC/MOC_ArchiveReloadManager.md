Purpose

The customer is responsible for backing up data in a  data  archive and for restoring data. When data is

backed  up  it  is  transferred  from  the  long-term  data  area  to  the  archive  data  area  and,  as  a  result,  it  is

stored in a separate file system. The customer can start the backup process using the Reload Manager.

When data, which is filed in the archive data area, is restored, it is transferred back (copied) to the long-

term data area. The customer has to do this and bears the responsibility.

To be able  to  evalaute restored  data using standard  evaluations/reports, the data has to  be transferred

back (copied) to the reload data area.

For this reason, the Reload Manager enables the following functions:

1.  Moving of exported data into the customer archive (the customer archive path has to be defined

within the HYDRA path settings).

2.  Loading of exported data into the reload area for evaluations

Integration

The Reload Manager is a central function that is used by many components or functions.

Selection Criteria

The application provides the following selection criteria:

Module

Reference to the product group which archived data belongs to.

Toolbar

Export

The “EXPORT” button allows for the entries selected in the Reload Manager to be exported to the

customer  directory  (all  data  records  can  be  selected  using  the  context  menu  of  the  right  mouse

button).  Once  the  function  has  been  started,  the  input  dialog  that  opens  requires  the  customer

archive path to be entered.

Import

The “IMPORT” button allows for the selected entries to be loaded into the reload area, in order for

the data to be again available for HYDRA evaluations/reports. Once the function has been started,

the data loading mode and an optional  path are requested. By indicating the path, it is possible to

specify another storage location for the files, provided that the archived files have not been moved

to the customer-specific archive using the Reload Manager.

There are three different ways to deal with reload data after they have been reloaded to prevent the

reload data set from increasing excessively ( no slow evaluations/reports):

The following modes are distinguished:

  Cyclic

Data is loaded to the reload area in the “cyclic” mode. Loaded data is automatically removed from

the corresponding reload tables, once the retention period specified within archive settings has

expired.

Please compare the configuration entry HYD / RELOADMANAGER of the data management

function. When demo settings are used, data is removed from the reload area after 14 days.

When data is imported, the HYD_REL_MANAGEMENT.DELETE_DATE field is calculated

subject to the configuration and entered in the reload management table.

  User-specific

Data is loaded to the reload area in the “user-specific” mode. The loaded data is automatically

removed from the corresponding reload area, once the time specified for the user within the user-

specific settings has expired. Exception: In case several users loaded identical data into the

reload area, the corresponding retention period is automatically set to the maximum date.

When data is imported, the HYD_REL_MANAGEMENT.DELETE_DATE field is computed

subject to the configuration and entered in the reload management table.

  Manual

Data is loaded in the “manual” mode to the reload area. The customer is responsible for deleting

data from corresponding reload tables. However, identical data cannot be loaded several times in

the “manual” mode (data can be loaded in the “user-specific” mode though).

In  order  for  data  to  be  transferred  to  the  reload  data  area,  the  HYDRA  server  must  be  able  to

access these files. Otherwise, loading is cancelled with an error message.
